    </h2>
    <p>The Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, a pivotal quantum computing algorithm, efficiently solves a specific problem—finding an unknown binary string by querying a black-box oracle. In classical computing, this would require multiple queries, but Bernstein-Vazirani achieves this in a single step. Its applications span cryptography, where it can enhance secure communication protocols, and optimization problems, showcasing quantum computing's potential to outperform classical counterparts. As quantum technologies advance, Bernstein-Vazirani stands as a testament to the transformative power of quantum algorithms in solving real-world challenges efficiently, paving the way for quantum supremacy in diverse computational domains.</p>

        <a href="grover.ipynb">Grover's Search Algorithm</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Grover's algorithm, a quantum algorithm devised by Lov Grover in 1996, revolutionizes search problems. Traditional algorithms require N steps to find an item in an unsorted list, but Grover's quadratic speedup reduces this to roughly √N steps. Its potential applications extend beyond mere search functions, impacting cryptography, optimization, and database searches. Grover's algorithm poses a threat to widely-used cryptographic schemes like RSA by efficiently solving the unstructured search problem, prompting the need for quantum-resistant encryption methods. In optimization tasks, it offers exponential speedup, enhancing efficiency in various computational domains and marking a significant stride in the realm of quantum computing.</p>
